Hello Bitcoin seller!

Welcome to selling bitcoins on LBC! Some of us sellers have been selling on this platform for years, and many of us have experienced scams that has resulted in victims losing money. I’ll describe the most common type of scam you should be aware of to not only protect yourself, but also to protect our fellow Singaporeans.

Example of 3rd party scam
Overseas scammer advertises on Carousell that he is selling latest iPhone for $500.
Singaporean victim contacts scammer, tells him he want to buy the iPhone.
Scammer opens $500 trade with you on LBC, asks for your bank details.
Scammer forwards bank details to Singaporean victim.
Victim pays $500 to YOUR bank account.
You see $500 deposited into your bank account.
You release BTC to scammer.
Scammer runs away with BTC.
Victim eventually realizes he was scammed and makes a police report.
Police freezes your bank account, and comes knocking on your door for investigation.

You may ask why don’t the scammer give his own account number to the victim he’s scamming? Mainly because these scammers tend to be overseas. Most Singaporeans would not wire money to someone outside Singapore, but are willing to send to a Singaporean bank account, fals
ely thinking that it’s safe and the police/bank can always help them recover the money if it is a scam.

How to prevent 3rd party scams
Ask for photo of ID (NRIC or passport) together with a handwritten note that says “buying bitcoins from YOURUSERNAME on localbitcoins.com”. Note that a photo of the ID is NOT sufficient, because the scammer can ask the victim to send his ID for “verification”, and the scammer will simply forward it to you.
If in doubt that the ID is real, ask for the camera flash to be turned on. This will reveal some security features which you can see in the flash reflection of the ID.
If you suspect the photo is photoshopped, you can ask for a different angle of the same ID and note, and the buyer should produce it quickly. If he takes too long, he might be spending the time to photoshop the new picture. Alternatively, ask for a video of the ID and note, as videos are much harder to photoshop.
If still suspicious, you can ask for victim to take a selfie holding up the same ID and same note. Or you can also video call him (skype/whatsapp) and ask to see the ID and note.
When you finally think the buyer is legit, then reveal your bank details to buyer and ask him to pay and importantly to write “bitcoin purchase” in the transaction comments. This ensures that the payment is for bitcoin and not for any other purpose which would be 3rd party scams.
When you receive the funds, ensure that the sender name as shown in the payment matches the ID verified name and the “bitcoin purchase” comment is present. Note that DBS bank does NOT show you sender name, so do not use DBS to accept payment. Almost all other local banks show you the sender name.
Note that all internal transfers (such as OCBC to OCBC) do NOT show you sender name. Thus, you might want to have accounts at 2 banks that are not DBS. This way, you can get buyer to send via FAST transfer to another bank.

Other scams
Facebook scam. Here, the scammer has hacked into victim A’s Facebook account, and then talks to victim B (who is victim A’s facebook friend), pretending to be victim A. Scammer will then convince victim B to send him money for an “emergency” and promises to return it very quickly.
Money mules. Some naive Singaporeans answer advertisements to work as “accountants” in which their job is to “process payments for a company” just by receiving money in their bank and sending it out on instruction. The scammer will then instruct these money mules to send you money to buy bitcoins.
Love scams. Victim sending money to you has been sending money to a fake lover. These scams are harder to detect because the victim will be in denial, will not be truthful, and will likely not report to the police out of embarrassment.
